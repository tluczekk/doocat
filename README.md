Lightweight app to check current PLN exchange rates fixed by National Bank of Poland. Project's aim 
is to apply newly acquired Flutter knowledge in real life use case. Although there are numerous, 
fancy currency exchange rates trackers, aim of *doocat* is to just quickly check what are the 
rates right now without taking too much resources. Bear in mind, that given rates might, and most 
probably will differ with what you are going to see at your bank/exchange, due to different spreads.
